# ByteSite

This was a project I did back in 2015 which was a website that Twitch Streamers could purchase and it would be an all in
one website for them. This project was done in 2015 and it's very very sloppy to my modern day work.

ByteSite contains:
- [Twitch Sub Alerts with Donation store](admin/alerts)
- News System
- Item System (Users could buy and sell items)
- An Item Store
- Sponsor Tab
- Messaging
- DJ System
- A built in economy with points they could earn watching a streamer and playing chat games (Look at TheAveryBot for more)
- [Twitch Theater mode before it was a thing](watch.php)
- [For some reason a stopwatch?](admin/alerts)
- A lot of useless SQL tables that you have to manually create
- An unfinished chat system
